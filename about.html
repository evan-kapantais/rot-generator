					<h1>The ROT Algorithm</h1>
					<p>
						The
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13">ROT13</a>
						is a very simple letter substitution cipher that replaces each
						letter in a text string with the 13th letter after it in the
						alphabet. The ROT13 is a version of the
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher"
							>Caesar cipher</a
						>
						that was developed in ancient Rome. The original cipher did not have
						a fixed amount of displacement.
					</p>
					<p>
						The ROT13 is its own inverse. This means that the original sequence
						of letter is generated is the algorithm is applied twice to a given
						string (given that the English alphabet is 26 letter long). Just
						because of its simplicity, use of the ROT13, or any variations of
						it, is heavily discouraged when it comes to password encryption.
						Although is provides some measure of security - albeit very minimal,
						especially when it comes to more sophisticated means of password
						cracking - it is mostly reserved for information that needs to be
						inconspicuous at first, such as spoilers or puzzle solutions.
					</p>

					<h1>This Implementation</h1>
					<p>
						Although the ROT13 is the most widely used cipher, I have included
						here all 13 rotations (ROT1 - ROT13), as well as the option to
						rotate a sequence backwards. Number digits are rotated in the same
						fashion from 0 through 9 (and backwards), while special characters
						and symbols remain unaffected.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>A Word of Caution</h1>
					<p>
						I suggest that you apply the ROT algorithm with caution and don't
						rely on it when it comes to sensitive data. Passwords using the ROT
						algorithm can become only marginally stronger, as they provide some
						defence only against guesswork and adversaries that are not aware of
						the existence and application of the cipher.
